# RPI

## Inputs

* <task>: (Required) Task description or target outcome.
* <continue>: (Optional) Resume the active task from its durable RPI artifacts.
* <followUp>: (Optional) Select a distinct follow-up item from a prior review.

## Requirements

1. Use `<task>` as the primary task context and start with research readiness.
2. Sequence `rpi-research`, `rpi-plan`, `rpi-implement`, and `rpi-review` as needed. Planning owns independent critique, implementation owns amendments and divergence records, and review owns outcome routing.
3. For `<continue>`, resume the active task at the earliest stage affected by existing evidence. For `<followUp>`, route the selected item to research, planning, implementation, or a distinct new task.
4. Summarize current lifecycle stage, artifact paths, validation evidence, review execution status and outcome, and the routed follow-up.
