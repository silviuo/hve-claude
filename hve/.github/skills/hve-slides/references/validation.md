# Validation

## Choose the Evidence Before Editing

Name the changed behavior and its smallest rejecting check. Use existing package tests and
browser tooling; add a test only for a new or changed contract. A sentence correction does
not need a fresh framework audit. A global style change needs broader visual coverage than
a local wording change.

For a scoped update, inspect the changed slides/states and representative shared-component
consumers. For a new deck, global CSS change or major restructuring, cover all slides and
every materially distinct example state. Reuse unaffected evidence only when its source
revision and scope still apply.

## Source and Build Checks

* Check syntax, required mounts, unique slide IDs, valid citation keys and supported demo
  kinds. Keep startup errors visible; missing required source must not produce a blank deck.
* Exercise finite next/back/reset behavior, independent demo state, question/answer pairing,
  and source/diagram or diff/count parity where those features exist.
* Use the selected deck's build/tests and inspect their output. Keep commands scoped to its
  package; do not launch adjacent CI lanes or tools described in example content.
* Verify generated files match current source, declared runtime assets are local or embedded,
  and license notices survive packaging.
* Update directly related README commands and counts. Prefer stable title/ID references to
  slide numbers when describing features likely to move.

A test can report that it rebuilt output; it cannot establish browser execution. Mechanical
checks and screenshot inspection answer different questions.

## Generated HTML and CodeQL

Run `npm run slides:check` before changing or publishing the generated HTML. It rebuilds
ignored intermediate assets, compares every bundle with its current source, and fails
on missing, stale, or orphaned HTML without rewriting the committed bundles. Regenerate
with `npm run slides:build` when the source changes.

CodeQL excludes only `docs/slides/*.html`, which contains embedded copies of third-party
code alongside generated first-party code. Authored JavaScript, TypeScript, and build
scripts remain in scope. The CodeQL workflow requires the source-to-bundle check in a
separate job before analysis, so generated intermediates do not enter the scan workspace.
This avoids scanning vendored reveal.js again inside generated HTML; it does not establish
that upstream library findings are fixed. Keep dependency audits and notice checks.

The starter and HVE Updates disable reveal.js `postMessage` commands and events because
they do not need cross-window control. Presenter buttons and local keyboard navigation
remain the supported controls.

## Browser Workflow

Use the host's permitted browser automation or browser canvas. A canvas opening alone is
not execution evidence. Do not use computer-use. If configured browser tooling is missing,
inspect an already available permitted alternative; do not install a browser or start a
service without the required separate permission.

Keep inspection batched:

1. Plan the relevant slide IDs, demo states, viewports and expected outcomes before opening
   a browser. Capture screenshots and computed geometry/contrast information together where
   possible. Use the existing build rather than creating a second preview implementation.
2. Inspect the rendered result at desktop presentation sizes. For the reference layout, use
   1600 by 900 and 1280 by 720; for a new layout, retain those targets or record an approved
   alternative. Check a compact viewport for essential controls, not full-projector text.
3. Read representative full-size frames and contact sheets for whole-deck composition.
   Compare text baselines, node/edge alignment, content density and bottom-control clearance.
   Computed overflow alone misses obscured elements, wrapping and poor visual hierarchy.
4. Gather all material findings, apply one compatible correction batch, then verify the
   affected final states. Run another pass only for a remaining defect, new evidence or
   changed scope; do not loop through cosmetic alternatives without a reason.

When a design hook is active, consume its findings instead of launching a duplicate detector.
Classify false positives narrowly against the actual brief. A clean detector is not proof
of good design; preserve user-approved screenshot fidelity and literal technical distinctions.

## Interaction Checks

Use actual browser inputs, not only calls to internal transition functions.

* Slide keys/buttons, first/last boundaries, slide index, hash navigation and reload work.
* Each walkthrough moves forward/back, reaches its endpoints and resets independently.
* Local toggles and reconstructed walkthrough buttons perform only their declared local
  behavior; display-only chrome does not become a dead keyboard stop or execute real tools.
* Focused inputs, buttons, selections and modifier shortcuts are not hijacked by deck keys.
* Dialog Tab/Shift+Tab, Escape, focus return and reopening work. Scrolling one dialog must
  not hide the top of the next view. Close controls remain reachable on narrow screens.
* Optional motion settles, reduced motion overrides it, and leaving a slide does not leave
  an unwanted live process or interaction running.
* Labels, selected-state text, SVG alternatives, live announcements and visible focus are
  present where relevant. Check contrast on actual backgrounds, including code and hints.
* Read the browser console and runtime requests. Distinguish local/data resources from
  network dependencies. Do not claim offline behavior from a cached online run.

The [ARIA dialog pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/) and
[reduced-motion guidance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/animation-from-interactions.html)
inform these checks. They do not make a scoped browser pass an accessibility certification.

## Single-File Check

When delivering one HTML file, copy only that file to an isolated temporary directory,
optionally rename it, disable network access in the browser context and open it. Exercise
the relevant interactions and inspect attempted requests. Compare representative rendered
states against the folder build; neither version may rely on hidden sibling assets.

Preserve the library notice and confirm notes are intentionally shareable. Delete only
the temporary test files/directory created for this check. Do not remove the user's source,
working tree or general evidence root.

## Final Handoff and Limits

Return the actual entry file and exact build/bundle command. Name required checks not performed
and the smallest action that would allow them to run. Distinguish:

* Source updated, build not yet produced
* Folder build verified
* Single-file build verified in isolation
* Scripted or recorded example versus actual execution

Do not label a deck ready for live presenting when required interactions are untested.
Physical projector readability, real assistive-technology use, external installation and
published-host behavior require their own evidence. Acknowledge those limits without
inventing extra work the user did not request.
