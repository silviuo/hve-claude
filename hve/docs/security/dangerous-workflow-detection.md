## Overview

This page documents the defensive CI control that guards against risky GitHub Actions
workflow patterns before merge. The control is a hybrid of two complementary parts:

* A **homegrown template-injection gate** that runs in PR validation as a fast, deterministic,
  offline **blocking** check and surfaces findings in the Security tab as SARIF.
* The **Poutine** supply-chain scanner, which runs as a broad **advisory** scanner in CI and
  uploads its findings to the Security tab as SARIF without blocking merge.

## The homegrown gate (blocking)

The homegrown check enforces one rule with two detection sources, both reported under the
same rule identifier:

* `dangerous-workflow/template-injection`
  * **Untrusted event values.** Triggered when attacker-controllable GitHub event values are
    interpolated directly into `run:` or `github-script` code execution contexts.
    The narrowed scope covers free-text and ref fields such as `github.event.pull_request.title`,
    `github.event.pull_request.body`, `github.event.pull_request.head.ref`,
    `github.event.pull_request.head.label`, `github.event.issue.title`, `github.event.issue.body`,
    `github.event.comment.body`, `github.event.review.body`, `github.event.review_comment.body`,
    `github.event.discussion.title`, `github.event.discussion.body`, `github.event.head_commit.message`,
    `github.event.head_commit.author.*`, `github.event.commits[*].message`,
    `github.event.commits[*].author.*`, `github.event.workflow_run.head_branch`,
    `github.event.workflow_run.display_title`, `github.event.pages[*].page_name`, and `github.head_ref`.
  * **Workflow inputs.** Triggered when a workflow input is interpolated directly into the same
    execution contexts. Input declarations are resolved from every trigger that declares them, so a
    `workflow_dispatch` input is treated exactly like a `workflow_call` input. Inputs declared
    `boolean` or `number` are validated by GitHub before the runner receives them and are never
    reported; a name declared by more than one trigger is exempt only when every one of its
    declarations is typed `boolean` or `number`. Compound expressions such as
    `${{ inputs.max-age-days || 30 }}` are classified on every input they reference, so
    `${{ inputs.a || inputs.b }}` is reported when either `a` or `b` is unsafe.
  * Indirect derivations through `steps.*`, `needs.*`, `matrix.*`, and `env.*` are intentionally out
    of scope to keep the rule deterministic and low-noise.

The input rule detects deviation from the safe pattern rather than attempting to prove a value is
tainted. The safe pattern is a step-level `env:` mapping read through native shell syntax:

```yaml
- name: Run validation
  env:
    INPUT_WORKING_DIRECTORY: ${{ inputs.working-directory }}
  run: |
    echo "$INPUT_WORKING_DIRECTORY"
```

The value then reaches the shell as data and is never parsed as command structure, so the control
holds without filtering the value first.

This gate is PowerShell-native, has no runtime dependencies, and runs offline as part of
`npm run validate:local`.

## Broad coverage via Poutine (advisory)

Broader dangerous-workflow coverage is delegated to [Poutine](https://github.com/boostsecurityio/poutine),
an Apache-2.0 supply-chain scanner maintained by BoostSecurity. Poutine runs in CI and reports a
wider class of issues as advisory SARIF, including:

* Untrusted checkout / arbitrary code execution from untrusted code changes (`untrusted_checkout_exec`).
* Template injection across a broader surface than the homegrown gate.
* Unpinned or unverified third-party actions.
* Pull-request jobs running on self-hosted runners.
* Known vulnerabilities in build-platform components.

Poutine findings appear in the Security tab under the `poutine` category. They are **advisory**
and do not block merge; the homegrown template-injection gate is the only required check.

## Scope and limitations

The split is deliberate:

* The homegrown gate stays narrow, deterministic, and offline so it can block with near-zero
  false positives.
* Poutine provides breadth and is maintained upstream, but runs advisory to avoid a noisy hard gate.
* The `# poutine:ignore untrusted_checkout_exec` marker is honored by Poutine to acknowledge
  reviewed checkout exceptions. It does not affect the homegrown template-injection gate.
* Taint-based expansion of the injection rule (indirect derivations) remains tracked as follow-on work.
  CodeQL's `actions/code-injection` query models untrusted sources as `github.event.*` values, so it
  does not report workflow-input interpolation either; the homegrown input rule covers that case.
* A repository-derived value that reaches a `run:` block through a dynamic job matrix is an indirect
  derivation and is not reported here. Project discovery paths are validated separately by
  `scripts/security/Assert-WorkflowProjectDirectory.ps1` before they enter a matrix.

## Why this exists

This control closes a pre-merge gap. OpenSSF Scorecard can report dangerous workflow findings, but
it only runs on the default branch, so a risky workflow can reach the PR branch and merge before the
repository sees the issue. The homegrown gate brings a deterministic blocking signal into PR
validation, and Poutine adds broad supply-chain coverage on top.

## Run it locally

Run the homegrown gate:

```bash
npm run lint:dangerous-workflow
```

The command scans `.github/workflows` and writes results to the local logs directory. Poutine is a
CI-only scanner and is not part of the offline lint pipeline.

## Suppression

Use the suppression marker only when a checkout is genuinely trusted and the exception has been
reviewed. The marker is recognized by Poutine on the checkout step line itself or on the immediately
preceding line:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4 # poutine:ignore untrusted_checkout_exec
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.ref }}
```

Advisory Poutine findings can also be acknowledged in `.poutine.yml` by rule, path, or level once
triaged.

Use this only for a legitimate trusted checkout. Review expectations:

* The checkout target must be a trusted constant or otherwise intentionally approved.
* The comment should be added only after a human review confirms that the workflow truly needs the exception.
* Suppressions should be temporary and removed when the workflow is refactored to a safer pattern.

## Triage flow

When the required homegrown check fails, resolve the blocking `dangerous-workflow/template-injection` finding:

1. Open the failing check and read the SARIF finding for the affected workflow and line. The homegrown gate emits the stable rule ID `dangerous-workflow/template-injection` at `level: error`.
2. Locate the `run:` or `github-script` block that interpolates an untrusted event value.
3. Replace the interpolation with a trusted value, route the untrusted value through an intermediate `env:` variable, or restructure the workflow so the untrusted payload is never executed as code.
4. Re-run `npm run lint:dangerous-workflow` and re-check the PR validation status.

Advisory Poutine findings such as `untrusted_checkout_exec` appear separately in the Security tab under the `poutine` category and do not block merge. Triage them by hardening the workflow or acknowledging the finding in `.poutine.yml`.
