## Policy

Every code-scanning alert on `microsoft/hve-core` is resolved in code or configuration. Nobody dismisses an alert in the GitHub UI, for any reason, including "false positive", "won't fix", or "used in tests". A dismissed alert disappears from the default alert list, from the weekly issue filer, and from anyone triaging the Security tab, while the code that produced it stays in place.

When a finding truly cannot be fixed yet, it goes through a [tracked exception](#tracked-exceptions). The alert stays open, the CI gate lists it, and an issue with an owner and an expiry date tracks the real fix.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you find a dismissed alert, reopen it and treat it as an open finding. The weekly filer reopens the conversation automatically by filing an issue for any dismissed alert that is still detected.

## Detection

| Source            | What it finds                                                                                                            | When it runs                                                  |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| CodeQL            | Security and quality findings in `actions`, `python`, and `javascript-typescript` source, plus the delivered slide decks | Pull requests, pushes to `main`, Sundays at 2 AM and 4 AM UTC |
| OpenSSF Scorecard | Repository posture, including branch protection and known-vulnerable dependencies                                        | Sundays at 3 AM UTC and on pushes to `main`                   |
| OSV-Scanner (VEX) | Dependency advisories not yet triaged in `security/vex/hve-core.openvex.json`                                            | Tuesdays at 8 AM UTC                                          |

CodeQL runs the `security-extended` and `security-and-quality` suites. Generated slide decks have their own category because they inline third-party Reveal.js; fix their findings in the deck source or the slide bundler, never in the generated HTML.

## Blocking New Findings

Two controls keep a new finding from reaching `main`.

### CodeQL threshold gate

After each CodeQL analysis uploads its results, `scripts/security/Test-CodeQLSarifThreshold.ps1` reads the SARIF output and fails the job when a result meets the threshold:

* a security result with `security-severity` of 4.0 or higher (medium, high, or critical), or
* a result from a rule without a security severity whose level is `error` or `warning`.

Note-level quality results pass the gate but still appear as alerts, and you still resolve them. Inline SARIF suppressions do not exempt a result, and a missing or unreadable SARIF file fails the job.

The gate runs inside the CodeQL job, which feeds `PR Validation Success`. That matters for the merge queue: GitHub's ruleset code-scanning protection does not evaluate merge-queue groups, but the gate does, because the queue runs the same validation. The gate counts every finding at the threshold, not only new ones, so a red gate on `main` means the baseline is no longer clean.

To reproduce a gate result locally, download the analysis SARIF and run:

```powershell
npm run security:codeql-gate -- -SarifPath ./python.sarif
```

### Ruleset code-scanning rule

Administrators configure a CodeQL code-scanning rule on the `main` ruleset that blocks a pull request introducing an alert at the same threshold; [Branch Protection](branch-protection.md) records the current ruleset settings.
The rule has no exception concept. If a [tracked exception](#tracked-exceptions) covers a finding on lines a pull request changes, that pull request needs an administrator to merge past the rule. The ruleset audit trail records the bypass, and the exception entry and its issue are the justification for it.

## Tracking

The [Weekly GitHub Code Scanning](https://github.com/microsoft/hve-core/blob/main/.github/workflows/weekly-gh-code-scanning.yml) workflow runs Mondays at 3 AM UTC and files or updates one issue per rule. Every issue it files is labeled `security`, `automated`, and `code-scanning`, so no automated issue waits on a triage pass. A hidden body marker identifies the kind of issue and keeps reruns updating the same issue instead of filing duplicates.

| Issue kind                   | Marker                                             | What it asks for                                                                                          |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Open alert                   | `automation:security-scan:<rule>`                  | Find the root cause and resolve it in code or configuration                                               |
| Dismissed but still detected | `automation:security-scan-dismissed:<rule>`        | Reopen the alert, then resolve it; the earlier dismissal does not count as a resolution                   |
| Tracked exception follow-up  | `automation:code-scanning-exception:<rule>:<path>` | The exception's issue was closed while the finding persists; fix it or renew the exception through review |

For each tracked exception, the same run also keeps one status comment current on the exception's issue, showing the rule, path, expiry, days left, and whether the alert is still open.

## Agentic Workflows

The repository's agentic workflows follow the same policy:

* Issue triage recognizes human-filed issues about a code-scanning alert, a Scorecard finding, or an exception, labels them `security`, links this page, and flags any request to dismiss an alert as contrary to policy. It skips bot-filed issues because the filer labels them completely.
* Issue implementation fixes the code. It never dismisses an alert, adds a CodeQL exclusion, query filter, inline suppression, `__all__` export, or allowlist entry, and never adds an exception. When no code fix exists, it comments with its evidence and stops so a maintainer can decide.
* Backlog grooming never recommends closing an issue whose alert, exception, or advisory is still open, and lists exceptions that expire within 14 days.
* VEX drafting links the upstream-bump issue for an advisory with no patched release, or asks the reviewer to file one.

## Resolving a Finding

1. Open the alert and read the rule's documentation to understand what the query detects.
2. Find the root cause. A finding in a test, a generated file, or vendored code is still a finding; change the test, the generator, or the bundler rather than the alert.
3. Fix it in code or configuration, with a test that would fail if the problem came back.
4. Open a pull request. Its CodeQL run must report no result for the rule, and the threshold gate must pass.
5. After the change merges, confirm the alert shows **Fixed** on `main`, then close the tracking issue.

Do not add paths to `.github/codeql/` ignore lists, add query filters, or restructure code only to hide a pattern from a query. Those approaches remove the evidence without removing the problem.

## Tracked Exceptions

An exception is the only way to let the gate pass while a finding remains. It applies only to a demonstrated analyzer false positive or to third-party code this repository cannot patch, after the problem is reported upstream.

1. Open an issue that explains the evidence and links the upstream report.
2. Add an entry to [`security/code-scanning-exceptions.yml`](https://github.com/microsoft/hve-core/blob/main/security/code-scanning-exceptions.yml) with the exact rule ID, the exact repository-relative path, the issue number, an owner, a one-line reason, and an `expires` date no more than 90 days out.
3. Get the change reviewed like any other pull request.

While the exception is active:

* the alert stays open on GitHub;
* the gate lists the result as excepted, with its issue and expiry;
* the weekly workflow keeps a status comment current on the issue, and files a new issue if the linked one is closed while the finding persists.

The gate fails when an entry has expired, expires more than 90 days out, is missing a field, has an unknown field, or no longer matches a result. Renewing an exception is a new review, not an edit to the date alone; restate why the fix is still blocked.

## Unpatched Dependency Advisories

A dependency advisory with no patched release cannot be fixed by an upgrade. It is handled in two places:

* A VEX statement in [`security/vex/hve-core.openvex.json`](https://github.com/microsoft/hve-core/blob/main/security/vex/hve-core.openvex.json) records whether this repository is affected, with code evidence for the status. See [VEX Verification](vex-verification.md) for how the document is published.
* An assigned upstream-bump issue tracks the upgrade once a patched release ships. The related Scorecard alert stays open until then.

Neither step adds an `audit-ci.json` allowlist entry or an allowed-advisory entry in the dependency-review workflow. If an advisory starts failing pull requests before a fix exists, raise it with the maintainers instead of adding an allowlist entry.

## Roles

| Role                   | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Contributors           | Fix findings your change introduces; resolve auto-filed issues you pick up; propose an exception only with an issue and upstream report           |
| Reviewers              | Confirm a fix removes the root cause; reject dismissals, ignore-list additions, and suppressions; review exception entries and their expiry dates |
| Maintainers and admins | Keep the ruleset's code-scanning rule in place; perform and justify any bypass merge for an excepted finding; reopen any alert found dismissed    |
